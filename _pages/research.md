My research interests are Game Theory, Market Design, Industrial Organization, and Microeconomic Theory. I have published papers in top economics journals, including **American Economic Review**, **AEJ: Microeconomics**, **Journal of Economic Theory**, and **RAND Journal of Economics**, as well as leading journals in other fields such as **AAMAS** and **Artificial Intelligence**.
