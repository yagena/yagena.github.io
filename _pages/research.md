I am a theoretical economist with strong interests in applications. My research primarily focuses on Game Theory, Industrial Organization, and Market Design. I have published papers in leading economics journals, including American Economic Review , American Economic Journal, and RAND Journal of Economics, as well as great journals in other fields such as AAMAS, Artificial Intelligence, and Scientific Reports.
