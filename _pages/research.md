My research focuses on Game Theory, Industrial Organization, and Market Design. I have published papers in top economics journals, including **American Economic Review**, American Economic Journal: Microeconomics, and **RAND Journal of Economics**, as well as leading journals in other fields such as **AAMAS**, Artificial Intelligence, and Scientific Reports.
