I am a **Professor** at the [Graduate School of Economics](https://www.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/), Osaka University. I have a BA from the University of Tokyo and a **Ph.D.** from Princeton University. Taking a sabbatical leave, I stayed at the [ISEG](https://www.iseg.ulisboa.pt/) in **Lisbon** from April 2021 to August 2022.

## My Research
I am a theoretical economist with a strong interest in applications. My research primarily focuses on Game Theory, Market Design, Industrial Organization, and Microeconomic Theory. I have published papers in top economics journals, including [American Economic Review](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/aer), [AEJ: Microeconomics](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/mic), [Journal of Economic Theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-economic-theory), and [RAND Journal of Economics](https://www.rje.org/), as well as leading journals in other fields such as [AAMAS](https://dl.acm.org/conference/aamas), [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/artificial-intelligence), and [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/srep/).
