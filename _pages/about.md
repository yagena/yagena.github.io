I am an **Associate Professor** at the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/), Osaka University. I was born in Tokyo in 1980 and speak English and Japanese. Prior to working at Osaka U., I was a faculty member at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies ([GRIPS](https://www.grips.ac.jp/en/)) from 2007 to 2014. As for my academic background, I have a bachelor's degree from the University of Tokyo and **Ph.D.** from Princeton University. Currently, I am taking a sabbatical and will be staying at [ISEG](https://www.iseg.ulisboa.pt/) in Lisbon, as a **visiting researcher**, until the summer of 2022.

I have published papers in top economics journals, including [American Economic Review](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/aer), American Economic Journal: Microeconomics, and [RAND Journal of Economics](https://www.rje.org/), as well as leading journals in other fields such as [AAMAS](https://dl.acm.org/conference/aamas), Artificial Intelligence, and Scientific Reports.
