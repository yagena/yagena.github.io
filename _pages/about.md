I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/), Osaka University. I am also a co-founder of [Economics Design Inc.](https://econ.news/) that aims to utilize economics in business. I was born in Tokyo in 1980 and speak English and Japanese. I will stay as a visiting researcher at [ISEG](https://www.iseg.ulisboa.pt/) in Lisbon until the summer of 2022.

My Research
------ 
I am a theoretical economist with strong interests in applications. My research primarily focuses on Game Theory, Industrial Organization, and Market Design. I have published papers in leading economics journals, including American Economic Review , American Economic Journal, and RAND Journal of Economics, as well as great journals in other fields such as AAMAS, Artificial Intelligence, and Scientific Reports. 

What's New?
