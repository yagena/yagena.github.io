I'm attending a special zoom lecture series on

* [Towards a General Theory of Markets with Indivisible Goods](https://www.mdc.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/special_lectures_2109/)

organized by the University of Tokyo Market Design Center ([UTMD](https://www.mdc.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/)). 

This is for free (registration via zoom is required) and all lectures are **in English** ! It's also very nice that the recorded movies will be soon uploaded in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvCPN-xoui6lhRexqB0XfVQ)).
