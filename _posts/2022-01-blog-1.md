I just uploaded a substantially revised manuscript of
“[On The Folk Theorem in Self-Sustained Communities](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3879767)” 
co-authored with Takako Fujiwara-Greve at the SSRN. 
(The link is posted in the comment section. You can download it for FREE 😉)

The questions we address in the paper are the following: 
- Is it possible to sustain cooperative behaviors in a community if the repeated relationships themselves need to be self-sustained by its members?
- If so, to what extent and by what kind of mechanisms? 

To answer them, we formulate a general framework in which players strategically choose in each period whether to repeat an N-person game or terminate it. We show that, even when the game duration is endogenous in this sense, the players can achieve non-myopic behaviors as much as possible (-> the folk theorem). BTW, a key mechanism is based on the "expulsion room" (追い出し部屋) method used by some Japanese firms 👍

We hope our research would contribute to a foundation for the folk theorem and a better understanding of the sustainability of cooperations AND communities 😊
