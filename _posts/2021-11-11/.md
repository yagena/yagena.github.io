I've heard that the service of classic Google Sites will end this year, but from this month I can't even edit web pages. So, following a kind [suggestion](https://alexisakira.github.io/posts/2020/08/blog-post-1/) by [Alexis Toda](https://alexisakira.github.io/), I decided to migrate to Github and just created a new website here ([English](https://yagena.github.io/); [Japanese](https://yagena.github.io/about_jp/)). Many thanks to Alexis!
